# DungeonMania
## Project Description
A dungeon-crawler browser game we made in attempts to explore the concept of design patterns such as the factory pattern and composite pattern in Java. This university project was completed as a team of 4 members who were new to Java and the concepts of design patterns, allowing this whole project to be a learning experience for us all. The HTML and server side code was provided by the university and coding the gameplay was our main objective.
